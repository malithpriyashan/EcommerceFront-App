# EcommerceFront-App
This is an ecommerce application template I have created. This application is
an online store where you can buy different kinds of technical items, such as
laptops, headphones, mouses, and many more. The UI of this application is
very appealing and modern-looking, and has animations. By using this site,
you can filter items through different categories and specifications. You can
search for items if they are hard to find, you can wishlist items that you can
buy later, you can review items that you like or dislike, you can set up an
account and see all your previous transactions, and the next time you log in,
you wonâ€™t have to go through the hassle of filling forms when you need to
place an order. The site makes it easy for a user to buy items using the add to
cart feature and also remove them. In order to process transactions, we have
integrated the site with Stripe payment method.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
